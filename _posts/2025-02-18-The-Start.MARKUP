# Welcome to the Adventure!

Hello, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

It is the start of my next adventure. Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

After some reading and research on how to learn Machine Learning and Neural Networks, it was suggested to keep a blog on the learning process in addition to using a cloud hosted Git server to track projects. That is the role of this blog. To capture that journey.
